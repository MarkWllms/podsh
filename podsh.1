.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B podsh [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpodsh\fP is a small podcast downloader written in \fBbash\fR. It is designed
to be robust, quick and easy to use, and with automation in mind. Add some
feeds, and then run it periodically (either manually or even better, from
cron(8)), and you should be able to enjoy continuously updated podcast media
files with minimal fuzz.
