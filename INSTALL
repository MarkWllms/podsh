INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Podsh requires that you have the commands `curl' and `xsltproc' installed and
available in your PATH. These are available on most common distributions and
operating systems (either already installed or available as packages).

The Bash shell must also be available at `/bin/bash' (edit top of script file if
the location differs in your installation).


INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
----------------------
To install podsh, simply copy the script file named `podsh' to some directory in
your PATH, for instance ~/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/. To also install the
accompanying manual page, copy the file `podsh.1' to /usr/local/man/man1.

Then simply run:
$ podsh -h

for help. Or:
$ man podsh

for manual page.
